# Hermie-s-Journey-Home

THIS IS MY PITCH FOR PROJECT ONE

# Game Discription:
### This will be a game centered around a poor hermit crab who has misplaced his shell. Without protection he has a life counter that will decrease everytime he runs into a rock, sand castle, or enemy. The objective is to survive the journey long enough to find your shell and get back to safety.
___
## This game will use HTML, CSS, Javascript, DOM Elements and Canvas.

# MVP Goals:
-Create a game with movement controls, life counter, and timed events
-Create different damage points based on seperate objets/enemies
-If you die, the screen says game over and you are forced to restart
-Have enemies move at different speeds based on their type
-End point is on a timer and will appear after 3-5 minutes, game will end once the player reaches this end point

# Stretch Goals:
-Create different levels with different speeds/times
-Create drawings myself and have them show up on the screen as art 
-Create a leaderboard that tracks health level after each level and remembers that value and records it in a leaderboard 
___
# Road Blocks;
-I make a lot of syntax errors and keeping track of that will be hard for me. 
-Making my code easy and readable and not conveluted.
-Creating timed events for each enemy object and when they will appear and move across the screen.
