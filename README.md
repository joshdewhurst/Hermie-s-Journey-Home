# Hermie-s-Journey-Home

THIS IS MY PITCH FOR PROJECT ONE

# Game Discription:
### This will be a game centered around a poor hermit crab who has misplaced his shell. Without protection he will die everytime he runs into a rock, sand castle, or enemy. The objective is to survive the journey long enough to find your shell and get back to safety.
___
## This game will use HTML, CSS, Javascript, DOM Elements and Canvas. 
___
# MVP Goals:
- Create a game with movement controls, life counter, and timed events
- Create different damage points based on seperate objets/enemies
- If you die, the screen says game over and you are forced to restart
- Have enemies move at different speeds based on their type
- End point is on a timer and will appear after 3-5 minutes, game will end once the player reaches this end point

# Stretch Goals:
- Create different levels with different speeds/times
- Create drawings myself and have them show up on the screen as art 
- Create a leaderboard that tracks health level after each level and remembers that value and records it in a leaderboard 
___
# Road Blocks;
- I make a lot of syntax errors and keeping track of that will be hard for me. 
- Making my code easy and readable and not conveluted.
- Creating timed events for each enemy object and when they will appear and move across the screen.

# Post Game Reflection
### Reflecting on this project, I realized that I am not good at taking things slowly, and starting where I am at and NOT where I want to finish. A huge amount of my time creating this animation loop, I spent trying to render images to move freely without traces, and I could have spent that time building my logic, redesigning my CSS, or working towards some of my stretch goals with what I knew how to do; draw shapes. 
## I also realized that I need to ask for help when I need it, instead of spending hours by myself trying to get a line of code to work. If I were to do this project again I would follow the below steps:
- brainstorm game
- write out on paper, what needs to happen, and general logic
- start with what I know before building out
- if I get stuck for longer than 45 minutes, ask for help
- build out once the basics are there
